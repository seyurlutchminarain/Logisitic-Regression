# Logisitic-Regression
Machine Learning model that performs Logistic Regression on a random dataset

A random dataset is generated on each execution of the model.
The dataset contains datapoints that belong to 2 seperate classes namely "class 0" and "class 1".

The model then generates a boundary line that seperates these two classes as accurately as possible. It is run over a:
- initial dataset
- validation dataset
- test dataset

in order to achieve optimal hyperparameters for the model.
